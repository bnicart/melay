<div class="">
  <b>WHAT IS DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS)?</b>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer-based information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities</li>
    <li>A computer program application that analyzes business data and presents it so that users can make business decisions more easily</li>
  </ul>

  <b>HISTORY OF DSS</b>
  <p>
    The concept of decision support has evolved from two main areas of research: The theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the technical work on Technology in the 1940s. DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, executive information systems (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single and model-oriented DSS.
    According to Sol (1987) the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years. In the 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on interactive computer based systems which help decision makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems. In the 1980s DSS should provide system using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities, and towards the end of 1980s DSS. In 1987, Texas Instruments completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for United Airlines. This decision support the system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various airports, beginning with Oâ€™Hare International Airport in Chicago and Stapleton Airport in Denver Corolado. Beginning in about 1990, data warehousing an on-line analytical processing began broadening the real of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new web-based analytical applications were introduced.
    By the 1980s, intensive research on DSS was underway, and new theories and concepts emerged from single-user models of DSS, including organizational decision support systems (ODSSs), group decision support systems (GDSSs) and executive information systems (EISs). By 1990 DSS was broadened to include data warehousing and online analytical processing

  <b>WHAT DSS GATHER</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Projected revenue and sales figures, some based on new product sales projections</li>
    <li>Comparative sales figures between selected time periods</li>
    <li>Inventory data organized into relational databases for timely analysis</li>
    <li>In some DSS applications, timely analysis includes the consequences of different decision alternatives</li>
  </ul>

<div class="">
  <b>WHERE DSS IS USED</b>
  <ul>
    <li>DSS applications are used in many diverse fields, including medical diagnosis, credit loan verification, evaluating bids on engineering projects, business and business management, agricultural production at the farm and policy levels, forest management and railroad (for evaluation of defective rails)</li>
  </ul>

  <b>EXAMPLE OF DSS</b>
  <p>
    A national on-line book seller wants to begin selling its products internationally but first needs to determine if that will be a wise business decision. The vendor can use a DSS to gather information from its own resources (using a tool such as OLAP) to determine if the company has the ability or potential ability to expand its business and also from external resources, such as industry data, to determine if there is indeed a demand to meet. The DSS will collect and analyse the data and then present it in a way that can be interpreted by humans. Some decision support systems come very close to acting as artificial intelligence agents.
