  <h3>Use of Computers in the Medical Field</h3>
  <p>
    Computers have become an essential part of every hospital. From doing basic things such as storing the details of patients, to more specific applications such as open-heart surgeries, X-rays, clinical tests, etc., everything is now computerized. These machines help in carrying out these tasks and medical procedures much more efficiently and effectively. There are many advantages of computers, which make them a must-have in the medical field. The following sections present a few of the wide array of applications of computers across different medicinal practices.

  <b>Computers in the Medical Office</b>
  <p>
    A computer plays an important role in every medical office setup. It contributes a lot to the hospital administration by assisting in all the administrative processes, such as maintaining staff records, recording incoming and outgoing time of the staff, keeping track of their holidays and leaves, etc. It would be really cumbersome to perform these procedures manually, but with the help of computers, these tasks are greatly simplified and made much less time-consuming. In most medical offices, accounting is also computerized, which helps in maintaining a daily record of all the financial transactions carried out. It also reduces the chances of money related frauds, as all the data is stored properly, and is readily available for future reference. A computer also helps in recording the names and contact details of the doctors and associated people, which is useful when it comes to recording the medical history of patients, such as previous treatments, tests, diagnosis, symptoms, etc. Such information comes in handy to the doctors, especially in the case of medical emergencies, or when a new treatment is to be designed. Many doctors, nowadays, also use computers to provide online counseling to patients who are unable to visit the hospital. Last but not the least, medical bills too are computer-generated, and hence, the chances of miscalculation are reduced, and availing online transaction facilities is also possible.

  <b>Computers in Medical Research</b>
  <p>
    The use of computers is also associated with research and inventions in the health sector. Various research studies are better carried out by using them. For example, studying certain cells, microorganisms, bacteria, etc., becomes easier by using computers. They can also be used for web conferencing, wherein, senior doctors can oversee and guide a medical procedure. One can create electronic presentations of various diseases or treatments, which can be used to train junior or trainee doctors for small and uncomplicated operations. For seminars and paper presentations on health related topics, computerized presentations create more of an impact on the audience, and also help them understand the issues better. With computer networking, doctors across the world can communicate with each other about new inventions, discoveries, unique health conditions, etc. Today, many countries across the globe are conducting individual research studies. The information collected by them can be mutually shared by the medical fraternity with the help of computers and Internet technology.

  <b>Computers in Medical Procedures</b>
  <p>
    Computers in the hospital also play a vital role for numerous specific purposes, apart from administration, accounting, billing, and appointments. They literally help doctors in performing surgeries, especially laparoscopic surgeries, where they insert operation tools and a small camera through a small incision made at the location of the surgery, and perform the operation with computers and monitors to guide them.

  <p>
    Many high-tech surgical machines and instruments are endowed with small, yet powerful computer systems, so that every surgical procedure can be recorded and monitored to avoid any complications. Many clinical imaging processes, such as X-rays and CT scans, etc., are conducted and examined with the help of computers. They also help in conducting various clinical and biological laboratory tests, which are useful for the correct diagnosis of different diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is virtually impossible for humans to note down every reading of the internal organs of the patients, which computers can do with ease. Hence, many critical patients, whose heart rate, lung movement, brain readings, etc., need be recorded, are monitored continuously using computers. Patients who need to be provided with life-support are put on special computerized systems. Thus, computers have become an inseparable part of the medical field. They greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of various medical procedures, and even help in important administrative and accounting related activities. Running the health sector today without the help of computers is simply unthinkable.
